# Typescript Command-Line Application

## Description

In this project, I create a command-line application using Typescript, node JS and Inquirer. The application collects user input using the inquirer package and uses the typescript compiler (TSC) to convert typescript code into JavaScript code. The project serves as a template for building interactive terminal-based applications that make use of typescript’s type safety.

## Installation

Ensure that you have Node JS installed on your system.

## Usage
To invoke the application, the user enters the command “npm run start” into the command line. The command line starts by asking the user whether they would like to perform actions on an existing vehicle or create a new vehicle. When they choose an option, the command line follows up with prompts that request user input and other actions that can be performed on that vehicle. The application outputs messages corresponding to user input and selections. The truck is the only vehicle with the ability to tow other vehicles. The motorbike is the only vehicle with the ability to do the wheelie. The user can also choose to exit the application at any point.

Below is a walkthrough video link demonstrating the functionality of the application.
