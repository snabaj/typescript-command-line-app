# Typescript Command-Line Application

## Description

In this project, I update an existing Typescript command-line application that builds a vehicle and gives an option to choose an existing vehicle. The application collects user input using the inquirer package and uses the typescript compiler (TSC) to convert typescript code into JavaScript code. The project serves as a template for building interactive terminal-based applications that make use of typescript’s type safety.

## Installation

Ensure that you have Node JS installed on your system.

## Usage
To invoke the application, the user enters the command “npm run start” into the command line. The command line prompts the user to either select an existing vehicle or create a new vehicle. When the user chooses to create a new vehicle, the command line follows up with prompts that request user input and other actions that can be performed on that vehicle. The selections include additional options for motorbikes to perform a wheelie and trucks to have the ability to tow other vehicles. The application outputs messages corresponding to user inputs and selections. The user is returned to the actions menu after each selection until they decide to exit the application.

Below is a walkthrough video link demonstrating the functionality of the application.
